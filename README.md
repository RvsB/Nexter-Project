# Nexter-Project

A responsive webpage based on CSS grid layout.

### **[Go to the Natours webpage](https://nex-ter.netlify.app)**

A Website entirely based on CSS Grid layout   

A webpage build entirely with the help of HTML, CSS and Sass, with the use of CSS Grid and a little Flexbox layouts to create the layout of the entire webpage.     

I used CSS for all the animation on this webpage and most of them are custom animations.
